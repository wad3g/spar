# Spar /sp√§r/
**[WIP]** A lean boilerplate using npm as a Build Tool.

**Spar** is the predecessor to **[Timber](https://github.com/wad3g/timber)**, a more feature packed/advanced boilerplate using webpack2 and yarn.


## Features

- Light NPM Build Tool
- PostCSS (minimal plugins - targeting consistency with CSS4)
- Autoprefixer
- BEM Naming Conventions
- CSS/JS Minification
- CSS/JS Source Mapping
- Image Minification/Optimization


## Get Started

Clone the repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/wad3g/spar.git
cd spar
```

Install the dependencies.

``` bash
npm i
```

Start watching files for compilation.

``` bash
npm start
```


## Scripts

**Spar** uses npm scripts as the build tool. Here's a list of available tasks:

##### `npm start`

Spin up a dev server of your app and compiles `/src/css/app.css` to `/dist/css/app.css`. The app should automatically launch in your browser. If you use a different dev server, the default / 404 route should be configured to `index.html`. Runs the `http-server`, `livereload`, `opener` and `watch` commands, which should automattically launch the app in your browser and watches for any changes in the `dist/` directory.

The `watch` command keeps multiple processes running at one timing by using [Parallelshell](https://www.npmjs.org/package/parallelshell). This means when a change is detected on one of your processes _only_ that process will recompile -- not the entire app.

##### `npm run build`

Only compiles the `/src/css/app.css` file and outputs to `/dist/css/app.css` without watching the file tree.

##### `npm run minify`

Uses [cssano](http://cssnano.co/) and [imagemin-cli](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-cli) to minify/optimize your CSS and images. You can run these tasks individually using `npm run minify:css` or `npm run minify:img`.

##### `npm run clean`

Delete `rm -vrf dist/*`  all existing `dist/` files.

##### `npm run watch`

Uses the following tasks, `watch:html`, `watch:css`, and `watch:img`, to watch for changes in `src/`, then recompile the changes to the `dist/` directory.

##### `npm run autoprefixer`

Adds vendor prefixes to your compiled CSS automattically

##### `npm run sourcemaps`

Generate sourcemaps.
